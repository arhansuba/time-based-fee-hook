# Time-Based Fee Hook for Balancer v3

This project implements a Time-Based Fee Hook for Balancer v3, allowing for dynamic fee adjustments based on the time of day or week. This innovative approach to fee management can help optimize liquidity and trading conditions in Automated Market Makers (AMMs).

## Features

- Dynamic fee adjustment based on time periods
- Customizable fee schedules
- Integration with Balancer v3 pools
- Improved capital efficiency and trading experience

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Truffle Suite

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/time-based-fee-hook.git
   cd time-based-fee-hook
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the Balancer v3 monorepo:
   ```
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   cd contracts/balancer-v3-monorepo
   npm install
   npm run build
   cd ../..
   ```

## Usage

1. Compile the contracts:
   ```
   truffle compile
   ```

2. Run tests:
   ```
   truffle test
   ```

3. Deploy the hook:
   ```
   truffle migrate --network <your-network>
   ```

## Configuration

To customize the fee schedule, modify the `TimeBasedFeeHook.sol` contract. You can adjust the time periods and corresponding fees in the constructor or create setter functions for dynamic updates.

The `LiquidityManagement.sol` contract provides additional functionality for managing liquidity in conjunction with the time-based fee mechanism.

## Balancer v3 Integration

This project uses the Balancer v3 monorepo as a submodule to ensure compatibility and access to the latest Balancer v3 contracts and interfaces. The `scaffold-balancer-v3` directory contains additional tools and scripts for working with Balancer v3.
